    <p>The journey towards <strong>armageddon</strong> comes with obstacles</p>
    <p>As the war rages on</p>
    <p>Many <strong>guardians </strong>are fighting for purposes</p>
    <p>Some for <strong><em>power</em></strong>, others for <em><strong>freedom</strong></em></p>
    <p>One warrior is fighting for <strong>vengeance</strong></p>
    <p>His <em>guardian angel</em> died in the battlefield</p>
    <p>He lost any purpose in life</p>
    <p>She <em><strong>sacrifice</strong></em> herself for him to fight forward</p>                
    <p>Her death shattered his inner state mine</p>
    <p>The angel loses her wing, but the warrior gains a demon spirit</p>
    
    <p>A demon spirit that woke his rage to go to the <em></em>battlefield</p>
    <p>Rebuilding a <strong>kingdom</strong> that he once build </p>
    <p>Inflicting a <strong>retribution</strong> for her killer as well as his <em></em>sin</p>
    <p>Fight for justice, fight for a new life, fight for a new path and destiny</p>
    <p>Make it impenetrable, unite the guardians as a comrade, MARCH as this is your last stand. </p>
